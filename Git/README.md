# Git Exercise
This folder contains the ipynb file for the Computer Science Lab's week 7 exercise.
The exercise was to create a Git repository on the student's system, add all the previous exercises from the previous lectures to this repository created and then to create and merge branches when developing the repository, therefore there is not much code here, only screenshots of the git status and log to comprove that the exercise has been completed successfully.
